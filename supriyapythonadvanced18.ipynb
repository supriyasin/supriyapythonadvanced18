    "    1. Endianness: Endianness refers to the order in which bytes are stored in memory. Python integers can be represented\n",
    "       in different byte orders, such as little-endian or big-endian. If the endianness of the integer on the disk differs \n",

    "       value.\n",

    "    2. Platform dependence: Python integers can have different sizes depending on the platform and the version of Python \n",

    "       considering the platform-specific size, it may lead to compatibility issues when reading the integer on a different\n",
    "       platform or with a different Python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Serialization format: When writing an integer to disk, it is essential to define a serialization format that determines\n",
    "      how the integer's bytes are stored. Different formats, such as binary, ASCII, or hexadecimal, can affect the size,\n",
    "      readability, and compatibility of the stored data. Choosing an inappropriate serialization format can result in data \n",
    "      corruption or misinterpretation when reading the integer. \n",
    "      \n",
    "   4. File format specification: When writing data to disk, it is crucial to follow a well-defined file format specification.\n",
    "      A file format typically includes information about the data structure, byte ordering, and any metadata associated with \n",

    "  files. One major benefit is that it automatically takes care of resource management, ensuring proper handling of system\n",
    "  resources and reducing the risk of resource leaks. Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Automatic resource management: The with statement guarantees that the file is properly closed, even if an exception or \n",

    "      context for file operations, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Error handling and exceptions: The with statement helps manage exceptions and error handling related to file operations.\n",

    "   4. Encourages best practices: Using the with statement promotes good coding practices by encouraging the use of the \"open\n",
